# Battle Royale Issuetracker

This is used to track bugs/issues and requests more easily with the community.

## Labels

Github uses labels for easier grouping, here's an explanation of them:

- **Idea** - A minor request which is easy to implement. A weapon is not easy to implement, changing font of the scoreboard is.
- **Major Idea** - A large request which might/will take a long time to develop. Including weapons, new menus, other functionality.
- **Modification** - A balancing or other type of modification that's required to make the gamemode better. This is different from a bug where a bug is a direct issue where modification is more an annoyancey type of thing.
- **Bug** - A gameplay or non-gameplay breaking issue. Code-wise or content-wise.
- **Higgs Bugson** - A bug which is hard to reproduce and only show up during specific circumstances.
- **Needs Testing** - A fixed bug or implemented feature that needs testing to ensure that everything is working properly.
- **Priority** - A feature/bug that has prioritization over other issues.
